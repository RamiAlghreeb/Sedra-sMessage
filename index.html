Hi Sedra , you might wanna read what I'm about to say.. that's if you're visiting the website i made you.


I'd like to let you know that the Sedra i loved is dead , the thoughts that cross my mind mourn her every single day .. There isn't an hour where you don't at least cross my mind once, since that random Tuesday on December 23rd - 2025 , I got left for no reason at all , we could've worked things out TOGETHER, but you chose not to.


I am making this on February 12 - 2026 , it's been almost 2 months since we really spoke , it sotra seemd like quite a day to you and your friends.
And to be honest, the first month after we've been apart has been a hell of a month on me .. i got through it until i asked to talk to you through your friend Esraa' , your freezing cold tone , the no questions about me kina helped me move on , helped me realize that you've never actually loved me , you were still in love with your ex jawad. That's if you even didn't leave me for him.


And since then , I've been living my life , Until I Had A Dream About You This Morning ..
It kinda brought me back , It actually did.
I sometimes really miss what we had , i miss your smile your voice your cheeks your presence ,the late night calls , even OUR SHARED BIRTHDAY that's in 26 days, I sometimes wish i hugged you back on that health center hill , and sometimes I'm gratefull i didn't .. a hell of meixed feelings..
I am actally writing this in English instead of arabic to cope with the fact that i still think about you to this day.


I am not waiting for you to be back nor do i want that , at least not that changed version of you that broke us apart , I just miss what we had once ...


Anyway, my guess is that you won't ever even read this as i don't think i'm crossing your mind as much as you cross mine.
I don't allow my soft feelings for you to creep in that deep usually since that day , but I couldn't help myself today.. I promise you that I'll be trying my best not to let that happen again..
Especially when i come back to your place to bury the bracelet you gave me, in the very same place you gave it to me as I am planning to do so in the coming couple of months.


Finally , My Sedra .. I won't be able to forget what we had nor will i be able to forgive you for destroying it , I've seriously lost faith in 99.99% of people, but quite frankly , I still love you and it looks like something i cannot get rid of , but you won't ever get to feel my love to you anymore.


Farewell
Rami.
